Generic Identity Device Specification (GIDS) smart card is the only PKI smart card whose driver is integrated on each Windows since Windows 7 SP1 and which can be used read and write. No Windows driver installation is required and this card can be used instantly.

[My Smart Logon](https://www.mysmartlogon.com/generic-identity-device-specification-gids-smart-card/)  is providing free of charge a javacard applet to transform a java card into a GIDS smart card and its integration in OpenSC for other operating systems (Linux, MacOSX, â€¦).

3 years of use without any bug reported!

## General requirements

* Card requirements
  * Java Card version 2.2.1 or above (see the list of [tested cards](https://www.mysmartlogon.com/generic-identity-device-specification-gids-smart-card/tested-cards/))
  * Implementation of the "requestObjectDeletion()"-mechanism of the Java Card API is recommended to be able to properly delete files.
* Requirements to use the card
  * Windows 7 SP1 / 2008 R2 or later for the "minidriver"
  * OpenSC (any platform) for pkcs11

## Download

Download [GidsApplet.cap](https://github.com/vletoux/GidsApplet/releases)

## Building

You can use the card SDK to build the applet or [ant-javacard](https://github.com/martinpaljak/ant-javacard).

The continuous integration platform script ([.travis.yml](.travis.yml)) can be executed to build the applet.

You will need to use JDK 11 to build.

## Installation

Install the CAP-file (GidsApplet.cap) to your Java Card smartcard (e.g. with [GlobalPlatformPro](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro)).
The release section includes compiled version of the applet.

Most of the time, the applet can be installed with the command:

```sh
gp --install GidsApplet.cap --default
```

Some cards require additional switch like for G&D `-emv` or Gemalto `-visa2 -key`. See this [page](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro/tree/master/docs/TestedCards) for more details.
MANY UNSUCCESSFUL GP COMMANDS (approx 10) CAN BRICK YOUR CARD. Contact your manufacturer for more information.
